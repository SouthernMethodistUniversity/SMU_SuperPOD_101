# RAPIDS

RAPIDS provides unmatched speed with familiar APIs that match the most popular PyData libraries. Built on the shoulders of giants including NVIDIA CUDA and Apache Arrow, it unlocks the speed of GPUs with code you already know.

## Installing RAPIDS
There are several ways to install RAPIDS to HPC systems

### Using Conda Environment
This is the simplest method and usable to both M2 and SuperPOD system.
You can install interactively, first, you just need to request a GPU node and load the corresponding library:

- In M2:

```bash
$ srun -n1 --gres=gpu:1 -c2 --mem=4gb --time=12:00:00 -p v100x8 --pty $SHELL
$ module load python/3
```

In SuperPOD:

```bash
$ srun -n1 --gres=gpu:1 -c2 --mem=4gb --time=12:00:00 --pty $SHELL
$ module load conda
```

Once the necessary module has been loaded, you just need to create the conda environment and install rapids, the following command get the latest standard version from https://rapids.ai/

```bash
conda create -n rapids-23.02 -c rapidsai -c conda-forge -c nvidia  \ rapids=23.02 python=3.10 cudatoolkit=11.8
```

If you have more personalized version, you can select the corresponding option and copy the command from rapids website: rapids.ai:
