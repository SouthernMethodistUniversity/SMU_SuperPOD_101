# 15. MINI PROJECT

## Description of Mini Project: 

- This Mini Project evaluates the ability of you working on a sample Data Science project from scratch.
- The project is about Supervised Machine Learning only
- It requires you to download data, clean data, split into training/testing and apply any machine learning model and analyse the output.


## Requirement:
- You can write the script in RStudio (on Palmetto's Open OnDemand or your PCs/Macs) and save it as your_username.R and send it to my email: **tuev@clemson.edu**. You can also upload to your github page and share to me
- **Note**: in order to get the **Certificate of Attendence**, you should send me the R script on or before **09/30/2021**.

## Data
- You can use *any* data in your field of expertise (most preferred method). If so, please send along the dataset with the Rscript
- You can also use *Kaggle* data which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) (second preferred method). Please elaborate in the ipynb how did you retrieve the data
- You can use use *Titanic* data from our [repo](https://github.com/clemsonciti/Workshop-Python-ML/tree/master/data/Titanic_data). 
Description for Titanic data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) (third preferred method)

## Method
In the R solution file I would like to see the following:
  - Clearly state the objective of the mini-project on Supervised Machine Learning
  - Brief explanation about the data that you will be using: source, predictors, predictand
  - Type of ML model output: Continuous or Classification?
  - Read in the data
  - Clean & Standardized the input data if needed
  - Split data to training/testing (You can also use Cross Validation if needed, not required)
  - You can use any Regularization (variable selection) or PCA if needed (not required)
  - Construct Machine Learning model to training set and explain why do you want to use that algorithm (any model is fine for me)
  - Apply Machine Learning model to predict the output from testing set
  - Evaluate the output using any of the given method in chapter 4
  - Confirm if your ML model is good or bad?
