# Hugging Face hub
- Hugging Face hub is considered to be Github of Machine Learning
- It is a platform with over **120k models, 20k datasets and 50k demo apps**, All open source and publicly available
- All in one platform where people can easily deploy, collaborate and build ML model

# Transformers library
- The Transformers library, developed by Hugging Face, has played a significant role in making state-of-the-art NLP models more accessible to researchers and developers. 
- It includes pre-trained models like BERT, GPT, RoBERTa, and more, which can be fine-tuned for specific tasks such as text classification, language generation, question answering, and more.
- The library offers a consistent API for various NLP tasks, making it easier for practitioners to experiment with and deploy these models.
  
# Model task
The screenshot below describes the model task from Hugging Face that covers many different aspecs from Computer Vision to NLP, Audio or Reinforcement Learning

# Pipeline for inference

- The ```pipeline()``` makes it simple to use any model from the Hub for inference on any language, computer vision, speech, and multimodal tasks. 
- Even if you don’t have experience with a specific modality or aren’t familiar with the underlying code behind the models, you can still use them for inference with the pipeline()!

## Pipeline for NLP Sentiment Analysis

```
from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
classifier("I am so excited to use the new SuperPOD from NVIDIA")

[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9995261430740356}]
```

```
classifier(
    ["I am so excited to use the new SuperPOD from NVIDIA", "I hate running late"])

[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9995261430740356},
 {'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9943193197250366}]
```

## Pipeline Text Generation

```
from transformers import pipeline
generator = pipeline("text-generation")
generator("Using SMU latest HPC cluster NVIDIA SuperPOD,  you will be able to")

[{'generated_text': 'Using SMU latest HPC cluster NVIDIA SuperPOD,  you will be able to connect to other SSE nodes such as the following and use them as a HPC node:\n\n[CPU: CPU1, GIGABYTE'}]
```

## Pipeline for Mask filling

```
from transformers import pipeline

unmasker = pipeline("fill-mask")
unmasker("This course will teach you all about <mask> models.", top_k=2)

[{'score': 0.19619698822498322,
  'token': 30412,
  'token_str': ' mathematical',
  'sequence': 'This course will teach you all about mathematical models.'},
 {'score': 0.04052705690264702,
  'token': 38163,
  'token_str': ' computational',
  'sequence': 'This course will teach you all about computational models.'}]
```

## Pipeline for Name Entity Recognition

```
from transformers import pipeline

ner = pipeline("ner", grouped_entities=True)
ner("My name is Tue Vu and I work at SMU in Dallas")

[{'entity_group': 'PER',
  'score': 0.9868829,
  'word': 'Tue Vu',
  'start': 11,
  'end': 17},
 {'entity_group': 'ORG',
  'score': 0.9965092,
  'word': 'SMU',
  'start': 32,
  'end': 35},
 {'entity_group': 'LOC',
  'score': 0.9950755,
  'word': 'Dallas',
  'start': 39,
  'end': 45}]
```

## Pipeline for Question Answering

```
from transformers import pipeline

question_answerer = pipeline("question-answering")
question_answerer(
    question="Where do I work?",
    context="My name is Tue Vu and I work at SMU in Dallas",
)

{'score': 0.3651700019836426, 'start': 32, 'end': 35, 'answer': 'SMU'}
```

## Pipeline for Conversational

```
from transformers import pipeline, Conversation
converse = pipeline("conversational")

conversation_1 = Conversation("What do you think about using HPC SuperPOD")
conversation_2 = Conversation("Do you believe in God?")
converse([conversation_1, conversation_2])
```

Answer:

```
[Conversation id: 44cf473c-29f2-4b44-be6c-15352dab13a2 
 user >> What do you think about using HPC SuperPOD 
 bot >> I think it's a good idea, but I don't think it's a good idea to use it for a lot of things. ,
 Conversation id: 489d923c-f127-4847-8cde-972c77470230 
 user >> What do you do to optimize the Python workflow? 
 bot >> I believe in the power of love.]
```

## Pipeline for Computer Vision - Image Classification
